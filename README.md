A terribly made C++ program that uses SFML library. At first when I started programming, I've always wanted a 
"How to make Chess" tutorial. Unfortunately, Youtube got me nowhere. The closest I had was from Sebastian Lague.
But what he made was a Chess AI, though, of course he walked everyone through how he made the chess game. But
I'm not content

# Credits
- Massively stolen code from [Sebastian Lague](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-AI)
- Sounds and sprites taken from [lichess](https://lichess.org)

~~It's actually called plagiarize~~

# Features

- Normal chess stuff
- Epic gamer code that can make your eyes explode (I hope not :)), feel free to suggest your epic improvements 
in issues, I'm open to hear them!)
- Idk

# Why not use SDL

SDL = headache = big nono

# Dependencies

* g++
* SFML library
* cmake
* make

# How to compile

Simply run the following command (assuming you're on linux cuz fuck Microsoft)

```
cd build
cmake .. && make
```

# Running

The texture will fail to load if you run it in the build directory, sorry :<. A way around
that is to run it in the project directory instead

```
./build/cpp-chess
```
